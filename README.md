# Dark-Exploration
https://vimeo.com/323694434

A musical interactive art installation where the user gets to explore a room in darkness through interacting with sound. A melody with four instruments/sound sources will play when positioned in the center of the room. Moving nearer different specific walls will enhance a specific instrument to get louder. All different walls have different instruments mapped to them. By this, we include people with visual impairments to explore art through exploring a room, by motion and sound interaction. 

This project was created in a room with 16 Motion Capture cameras and 8-channel speakers, using SuperCollider as the programming language. 

Created in a Sound in Interaction course together with a colleague (2019).
